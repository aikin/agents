# Quick Start Guide - MVP Implementation

**Goal:** Transform monolithic `app_deepseek.py` into modular architecture  
**Time:** 5-10 weeks (5 sprints)  
**Methodology:** Incremental feature delivery

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- [ ] Python 3.11+
- [ ] Git
- [ ] DeepSeek API key
- [ ] (Optional) Google API key for evaluator
- [ ] (Optional) Pushover account for notifications

---

## üöÄ Getting Started (Day 1)

### Step 1: Review Documentation (1 hour)
```bash
# Read these files in order:
1. ../adr/001-modular-architecture-with-rag-and-evaluator.md
2. ../adr/002-technology-stack-selection.md
3. ../adr/003-memory-management-strategy.md
4. MVP_PLAN.md (overview)
5. sprint_1_foundation.md (start here)
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment (30 minutes)
```bash
# Navigate to parent project (uses parent's package management)
cd path/to/agents/

# Activate virtual environment (should already exist)
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.12

# Install/update dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Project
```bash
# Go to career chatbot project
cd 1_foundations/exercises/career_chatbot_deepseek

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

## üìÖ Sprint Workflow

### Starting a Sprint

1. **Read the sprint file** (e.g., `plan/sprint_1_foundation.md`)
2. **Understand the goal** - What complete feature will you deliver?
3. **Review all tasks** - Understand dependencies
4. **Set up environment** - Add any new dependencies

### During Sprint

- **Work through tasks sequentially** - Each task builds on previous
- **Test frequently** - Run tests after each task
- **Commit often** - Small, focused commits
- **Update sprint file** - Check off completed tasks

### Completing a Sprint

1. **Run all tests** - Ensure everything passes
2. **Manual testing** - Test the complete feature
3. **Update retrospective** - Note what went well/poorly
4. **Tag the sprint** - `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Sprint 1 complete"`
5. **Move to next sprint** - Open next sprint file

---

## üíª Daily Development Workflow

### Morning Routine (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Check CI/CD status
# Visit GitHub Actions page

# 2. Review yesterday's work
git log --oneline -5

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 4. Plan today's tasks
# Update SPRINT_BOARD.md with today's focus
```

### Development Cycle (TDD Approach)

#### 1. Write Test First (Red)
```bash
# Create test file
touch tests/unit/test_my_feature.py

# Write failing test
cat > tests/unit/test_my_feature.py << 'EOF'
def test_my_feature():
    result = my_function()
    assert result == expected_value
EOF

# Run test (should fail)
pytest tests/unit/test_my_feature.py -v
```

#### 2. Write Implementation (Green)
```python
# Create implementation file
# Write minimal code to pass test
# Run test again (should pass)
```

#### 3. Refactor (Refactor)
```python
# Clean up code
# Improve naming
# Extract functions
# Run tests (should still pass)
```

#### 4. Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): add my_feature with tests"
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_database_service.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run only failed tests
pytest --lf

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_database"
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Format code
black .

# Lint code
ruff check .

# Fix linting issues
ruff check --fix .

# Type check
mypy --ignore-missing-imports .

# Run all checks
black . && ruff check . && mypy --ignore-missing-imports . && pytest
```

### Evening Routine (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Run full test suite
pytest --cov=.

# 2. Check coverage
# Should be > 70%

# 3. Commit and push
git push origin feature/story-X.Y-description

# 4. Update progress
# Update SPRINT_BOARD.md with completed tasks

# 5. Plan tomorrow
# Note any blockers or questions
```

## üìä Sprint Review (End of Sprint)

### Preparation (1 day before)
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Check test coverage meets target
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Prepare demo
- [ ] Collect metrics

### During Sprint Review (1 hour)

#### 1. Demo (30 minutes)
- Show completed stories
- Demonstrate new features
- Run live tests

#### 2. Metrics Review (15 minutes)
- Story points completed vs planned
- Test coverage achieved
- Bugs found and fixed
- Velocity calculation

#### 3. Stakeholder Feedback (15 minutes)
- What worked well?
- What needs improvement?
- Any new requirements?

### After Sprint Review
- [ ] Update `SPRINT_BOARD.md` with metrics
- [ ] Document feedback
- [ ] Update backlog if needed

---

## üîÑ Sprint Retrospective (End of Sprint)

### Format (30 minutes)

#### 1. Set the Stage (5 min)
- Review sprint goal
- Review what was accomplished

#### 2. Gather Data (10 min)
**What went well?**
- 

**What could be improved?**
- 

**What puzzled us?**
- 

#### 3. Generate Insights (10 min)
- Why did things go well/poorly?
- What patterns do we see?
- What can we learn?

#### 4. Decide What to Do (5 min)
**Action Items for Next Sprint:**
1. 
2. 
3. 

### After Retrospective
- [ ] Document in `SPRINT_BOARD.md`
- [ ] Add action items to next sprint planning
- [ ] Share learnings with team (if applicable)

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Test Failures
```bash
# Run specific test with verbose output
pytest tests/unit/test_database_service.py::test_save_conversation -vv

# Run with print statements
pytest -s tests/unit/test_database_service.py

# Run with debugger
pytest --pdb tests/unit/test_database_service.py
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Check if module is in PYTHONPATH
python -c "import sys; print('\n'.join(sys.path))"

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Delete and recreate database
rm data/career_qa.db
python -c "from models.database import init_db; init_db()"
```

### CI/CD Failures
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Reproduce locally:
   ```bash
   # Run same commands as CI
   ruff check .
   black --check .
   pytest --cov=.
   ```
3. Fix issues
4. Push again
