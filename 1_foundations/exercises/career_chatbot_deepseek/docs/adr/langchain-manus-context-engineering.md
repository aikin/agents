Here’s what I’d add after watching the LangChain × Manus webinar on context engineering for agents ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_BcCthVvb8)).

### Potential Enhancements for `adr/004-rag-design-and-context-engineering.md`
- **Context Governance:** add a “Context Policies” subsection covering per-tool/per-agent token budgets, priority tiers, and automatic fallbacks when sources are stale or missing.
- **Adaptive Compression:** document when to apply summarization or structured notes (bullet extraction, key-value compression) instead of raw chunks; note trade-offs between abstractive summaries and verbatim quotes.
- **Retrieval Monitoring Loop:** describe instrumentation for measuring stale hits, “no result” rates, and latency so the agent can adapt retrieval depth dynamically.
- **Human-in-the-loop Overrides:** capture the idea of letting operators pin or ban specific documents/sources; include an escalation path when the agent detects low-confidence retrieval.
- **Context Stress Testing:** add a checklist for synthetic load tests (oversized inputs, adversarial phrasing, polyglot queries) to validate context resilience before release.

### New Design Themes Worth Considering
- **Dynamic Memory Orchestration:** bring the webinar’s approach of routing context through layered memory (working, episodic, long-term) depending on task criticality—could live in ADR 003 as a refinement.
- **Task-Specific Context Profiles:** define different RAG pipelines (fast vs. deep retrieval) per agent task; might touch ADR 001 when we wire agents to services.
- **Telemetry + Guardrails:** introduce guardrail patterns (confidence scoring, contextual safety filters) and log forwarding for anomaly detection—future ADR focused on observability.

### Other ADR Updates?
- **ADR 003 (Memory Strategy):** consider weaving in the dynamic memory orchestration and guardrail insights.
- **ADR 001 (Architecture):** once the above changes are accepted, update the sequence/architecture diagrams to show the enhanced RAG pipeline and monitoring hooks.
- Otherwise, ADR 002 (tech stack) stays current unless new tooling from the webinar changes stack choices.


Here’s a concise set of high‑signal additions you can make to strengthen ADR 004 (and where relevant, updates to other ADRs), grounded in context‑engineering practices discussed in the webinar [LangChain + Manus: context engineering for AI agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_BcCthVvb8).

### What to add to ADR 004 (RAG + Context Engineering)

- Context Orchestration Layer
  - Add a “Context Orchestrator” component that allocates token budgets, routes between retrieval strategies, and applies fallbacks.
  - Include policies: when to use working memory only, when to trigger RAG, when to expand queries, when to abstain.

- Adaptive Retrieval Controller
  - Adaptive top‑k based on query complexity and current token budget.
  - Query rewriting / multi‑query expansion when similarity is low; back off when confidence is high.
  - Thresholds: similarity_min, diversity_min, latency_budget_ms.

- Retrieval Strategies Beyond Naive
  - Hybrid search (semantic + lexical/BM25) and metadata filtering (time/source/type).
  - Parent/child and contextual compression retrieval to reduce noise (keep only salient sentences within matched parent documents).
  - “Answerability check” (abstain if confidence < threshold; ask a clarifying question).

- Knowledge Hygiene and Lifecycle
  - Canonicalization on ingest: deduping, trimming headers/footers, normalizing whitespace, stripping boilerplate.
  - Versioning and document lineage (source, timestamp, hash, version) to help reranking and citation.
  - Scheduled re‑embedding cadence (e.g., weekly) and drift detection (embedding centroid shift).

- Context Safety and Governance
  - PII/PHI redaction before retrieval and again before context assembly.
  - Source whitelists/blacklists and “trusted source” weighting for reranking.
  - Prompt‑injection defenses: strip model‑targeted instructions from retrieved text; constrain tool names/parameters.

- Caching Strategy Matrix
  - Query cache (normalized query → result IDs), doc‑chunk cache (chunk → embedding), rerank cache (query,ids → order), prompt cache (context → response).
  - TTLs tuned by volatility (e.g., KB vs live web).

- Observability and SLAs
  - Trace spans for retrieve → rerank → assemble with latency, hit/miss, similarity stats, token counts.
  - Track: precision@k, MRR, context utilization (% of cited context referenced), regeneration rate, abstention rate.

- Latency/Cost Controls
  - Token budget allocator: dynamic slice for RAG based on estimated answer length.
  - “Fast path” (no reranker) for simple queries; “quality path” (cross‑encoder reranker) for complex/ambiguous ones.
  - Early‑exit when top‑1 similarity > high threshold.

- Memory × RAG Interplay
  - Write‑back policy: when a high‑confidence answer should be distilled into semantic memory.
  - Episodic indexing of high‑value turns to improve future retrieval.
  - Avoid feedback loops (don’t index model outputs unvetted).

Minimal inserts you can drop into ADR 004
- Add a “Context Orchestration Layer” subsection under Decision → Architecture, and note its responsibilities (budgeting, routing, fallback).
- Add “Parent/Child + Compression Retrieval” under Best Practices → Retrieval Strategy.
- Add “Knowledge Hygiene and Lifecycle” as a new section after Challenges.
- Add “Safety & Governance” as a new section (redaction, source trust, prompt‑injection hygiene).
- Add a “Caching Strategy Matrix” and “Observability” section with key metrics and traces.
- Extend “Latency & Cost” with fast/quality paths and early‑exit policies.

### Small config knobs to add (settings.py)
- similarity_min, diversity_min, adaptive_top_k_max
- reranker_enabled, fast_path_threshold, latency_budget_ms
- redact_pii_enabled, trusted_sources, disallowed_domains
- cache_ttl_query_s, cache_ttl_rerank_s
- reembed_interval_days, doc_versioning_enabled

### Impact on other ADRs

- ADR 001 (Modular Architecture)
  - Add “Context Orchestrator” box between Agents and RAG Service.
  - Update sequence to show adaptive retrieval, early‑exit, fallback tree (RAG → broaden query → web search → abstain/clarify).
  - Show Memory↔RAG flows (write‑back, episodic indexing).

- ADR 002 (Tech Stack)
  - Note optional reranker (cross‑encoder) choice (e.g., bge‑reranker‑base) and compression retrievers (parent/child, contextual compression).
  - Add tracing/metrics stack (e.g., OpenTelemetry hooks) and a simple cache layer (in‑memory + disk).
  - Document embedding refresh cadence policy and storage of doc lineage metadata.

- ADR 003 (Memory)
  - Define write‑back policy (when/how to persist distilled facts).
  - Guardrails to prevent storing sensitive content; add retention and purge policies.
  - Clarify how working/episodic/semantic memories are considered by the orchestrator before triggering RAG.
